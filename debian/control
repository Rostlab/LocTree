Description: sub-cellular localization predictor for all proteins in all domains of life
 LocTree3 is a combination of a homology-based (PSI-BLAST) and de-novo predictions
 (LocTree2) for the prediction of protein sub-cellular localization in life's three 
 domains, including globular and membrane proteins (3 classes for archaea; 6 for
 bacteria and 18 for eukaryota).
